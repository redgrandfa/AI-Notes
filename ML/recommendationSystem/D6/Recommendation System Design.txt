Utility Matrix
    relation between users and movies

    in reality, a utility matrix is created to map users onto the items.

    model for recommendation system will take
     a set of customers C and 
     a set of items (S) 
     as input for a utility function or utility matrix (u) 
     to generate a set of ratings (R).


     The utility function considers each pair of customer and item 
        and maps it to a rating. 
    Depending on your design, 
    R can be a set of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 or 1 to 10. 
    A low rating indicates that the user liked the product less while a higher rating indicates that the user liked it more.

====【重點】Recommendation System Architecture


1. explicitly and implicitly => Profile Builder


2. 【Candidate Generation service】
     compares the 【Individual Interests database】
    with 【Similar Items database】 
    to pick product candidates that could be of interest to the user.

    (【Similar Items database】 can be 
        the database of items used by similar users 
            (in the case of collaborative filtering) 
        or
        a database of items with similar features 
            (in the case of content-based filtering).)

3. Candidate Rating service scores each candidate
    based on the strength of similarities between user’s interest and the compared items.


4. Filtering service  filter out the candidates that have a lower score. 

5. The candidates with high scores that remain in the list are sorted 

6. appear in the list of recommendations for the user.
